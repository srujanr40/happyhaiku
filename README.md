# HappyHaiku

This Python application utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to analyze the sentiments of comments on Reddit. It detects the sentiment of the comments and checks if they resemble a haiku, a traditional form of Japanese poetry characterized by its structure of three lines with 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively. If a comment is identified as a haiku and is positive, the application replies to that comment with a message formatted as a haiku.
